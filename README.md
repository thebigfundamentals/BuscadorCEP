This project is part of JavaScript Ninja's course, by Fernando Daciuk. 
I am using an API to retrieve pieces of information from the brazilian zip code provided by the user. First, I made it using .XMLHttpRequest(),
but I refactored the code to use fetch(), so I could practice async/await (which is not taught in Daciuk's course, because it was made
before ES6 release). 
That being said, I am aware that the readability of the code is not ideal, as I do not have enough knowledge of good/bad practices 
and how to best format my code.
But, hey, it is working, so kudos to me.
